          <p class="text-white depts"> <br>The main aspects of Coding department revolve around the concepts of communication and data-transfer. Along with developing the Graphical User interface (GUI) for live plotting of the telemetry data, it is also responsible for maintaining the logs in CSV. This department's primary responsibility is to ensure successful wireless transmission and relay communication of sensor data between the payloads, container, and ground station. Being in charge of algorithm finalization and subsystem code compilation, as well as debugging and finalization of acceptable telemetry format compatible code, the programming languages and development environments to be utilised are also decided here. Storage of telemetry data 
            is also taken care of by the coding team.

Further, the selected sensors are then calibrated and connected together with the help of a structured code which fulfills the Competition standards and requirements.
              Afterwards, all the sensors are integrated together together on a PCB which is also designed and manufactured by the Electronics department. The department also overlooks the communication and telemetry of all the sensor collected data via efficient XBees used in various configurations.</p>

          <p class="text-white depts">The mechanical department of DJS Arya handles every aspect of the CanSat design and ensures that they meet with the optimal results. From selecting the right materials to assembling the physical components, the team plays a key role in CanSat manufacturing, to produce a streamlined, aerodynamic product. 
            Starting from scratch, the members collaborate to construct a detailed 3 dimensional model of the proposed CanSat, then make the necessary changes according to the requirements of the electronic components. Finally, this model is rendered from a variety of angles to put together gleaming, lifelike images that illustrate the design reviews.
            Afterwards, the CanSat is manufactured from scratch, using a variety of materials and instruments to reveal a spiffy product in keeping with the specifications and requirements of the competition.</p>
